 * @brief This program is for speed change option. You can choose a number between (0, 100000)
 * (0 and 100000 are not included) and then you choose the wave files you want to change the speed.
 * The speed of the changed music files will be x times faster than the original, where x is the 
 * number you chose. Note that x can be lower than 1, so if you choose a number between 0 and 1 (0,1)
 * the new file(s) will have lower speed. For example if you choose to change speed 0.5, the new file(s)
 * will be 2 times slower.
 * e.g.
 * ./wavengine -changeSpeed 2 piano.wav
 * Results: if piano.wav is in the same folder as wavengine, a new file will be created named "5-times-speed-changed-piano.wav" 
 * which is piano.wav 5 times faster
 * @version 0.1
